0.5 cup heavy cream","1. Turn on a multi-functional pressure cooker (such as Instant Pot®) and select Saute function. Brown beef in the hot pot with Italian seasoning and salt, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion and saute until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and saute for 1 minute. Stir in pasta, both cans of tomato sauce, and beef broth. Close and lock the lid.
2. Select high pressure according to manufacturer's instructions; set timer for 6 minutes. Allow 10 to 15 minutes for pressure to build.

4. Stir in Cheddar cheese until melted. Stir in baby spinach until wilted. Stir in heavy cream. Serve immediately.
5. Cook's Note:
6. You can use chicken broth instead of beef. This would also be good with Italian sausage instead of beef, and you can substitute other leafy greens for the spinach.",

2 tablespoons olive oil
1.5 cups diced fully cooked corned beef
3 cups cold cooked rice
0.25 cup water
2 tablespoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)
0.5 cup sliced green onion
2 teaspoons toasted sesame seeds
2 teaspoons sesame oil, or to taste
0.25 teaspoon soy sauce","1. Drain kimchi over a pot, reserving the juice.
2. Meanwhile, coat a pan with olive oil and add corned beef.
3. Chop kimchi into small chunks; add to the pan. Place pan over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until mixture is browned to your liking, 4 to 7 minutes. Add rice, kimchi juice, water, and gochujang.
4. Mix rice mixture together and spread evenly over the pan; cook for 3 to 4 minutes. Mix and pat rice down again. Continue cooking, mixing and pressing rice every 3 to 4 minutes, until evenly browned and crusty, 12 to 15 minutes total.
5. Mix green onion, sesame seeds, and sesame oil into the fried rice. Taste and season with soy sauce. Stir again. Transfer fried rice to serving bowls.
6. Chef's Notes:
7. I highly recommend you use a nonstick skillet for working with the rice.
8. Corned beef is optional, but if you do have some leftover from your St. Patrick's Day, I highly recommend you give it a try. Bacon is another fine choice, as is almost any other diced meat I can think of.
